  <h3>This is a simple site (at start) to create an RSA algorithm for my data security subject.</h3>
  <p>The reason why I want to use JavaScript for this is because of the continuous development around arbitrary-precision integers, cryptography.</p>

  <h3>If I follow the subject, the very first part is an algorithm which finds the greatest common divisor for two integers. We used the Euclidean algorithm for that.</h3>
  <p>I'm not going to implement the exceptions(e.g. a number is zero) because at the end of the project there shouldn't be any human interaction with the functions.</p>

    The greatest common divider is:

  <p>The next part is going to be an extended Euclidean algorithm...</p>
